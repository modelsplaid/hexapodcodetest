### I possess a Python script
```
I have a python script, say "test.py". I compiled it using setup.py, and the compiled executable file is "test". Then I wrote a Linux system service, and set the executable file to the ExecStart in the service file, which is "ExecStart=test". However, the service hadn't start. What is the reason?

I possess a Python script, referred to as 'test.py'. This script was compiled utilizing 'setup.py', resulting in the creation of an executable file named 'test'. Subsequently, I authored a Linux system service and designated this executable file as the target for the 'ExecStart' directive in the service configuration file, specifically 'ExecStart=test'. Despite these configurations, the service failed to initiate. Could you provide insight into the potential cause of this issue?"
